The Incredible Speech KeyboardThis project is a Linux equivalent of Google Keyboard's voice typing for Android, but built as a standalone GTKMM-based virtual keyboard. It's designed to provide a seamless and intuitive typing experience with a unique twist: integrated, real-time speech-to-text functionality. With just a click of a button, users can dictate their thoughts, and the transcribed text will be sent directly to the active application.This project aims to demonstrate how a simple virtual keyboard can be enhanced with powerful voice recognition capabilities, providing an accessible and efficient alternative to traditional typing.Key FeaturesReal-Time Speech-to-Text: Uses the Vosk API to convert spoken language into text on the fly.Virtual Keyboard UI: A graphical interface built with GTKMM for standard keyboard input.System-Wide Integration: Leverages X11 to send keystrokes and text to any focused application on the desktop.Simple Activation: Just a single button click to start or stop the voice recognition service.DependenciesTo build and run this project, you need the following dependencies installed on your Linux system:C++ Compiler: GCC (version 11.4.0 or newer is recommended)GTKMM 3.0: The C++ wrapper for GTK+ 3.0.Vosk API: The open-source offline speech recognition toolkit. You must also download a compatible Vosk language model.ALSA: Advanced Linux Sound Architecture for audio input.X11 Development Libraries: Specifically libxtst-dev for keyboard simulation.Getting StartedClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
cd your-repository-name

Download Vosk Model:Download a language model from the Vosk website and place it in a known directory.Build the project with CMake:cmake .
make

Current Status and Known IssuesThis project is currently a prototype and has a few known compilation issues that prevent it from running. The primary errors are related to missing members in the Keyboard class, such as signal_upper() and m_fn_key_map, which are called from keyboardbutton.cpp. We believe these are solvable with minor code changes.ContributionsWe would greatly appreciate any contributions to help get this project to a working state.  Whether you want to debug the existing code, add new features, or just provide feedback, all help is welcome.Feel free to open a new Issue to discuss a problem or create a Pull Request with your proposed changes.LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
